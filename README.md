# When Data that Do Not Conform to Rows and Columns: A Case Study of T-cell Receptor Datasets
###### JARED L OSTMEYER, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UT SOUTHWESTERN DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION AND DATA SCIENCES

## Introduction

Statistical classifiers are mathematical models that use example data to find patterns in features that predict a label. Most statistical classifiers assume the features are arranged into rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, but many kinds of data do not conform to this structure. Sequences are one example of a different kind of data, which is why this data is best stored in a text document, not a spreadsheet. To build statistical classifiers for sequences and other non-conforming features, we have developed what we call *dynamic kernel matching* (DKM).

We can think of DKM as analogous to the max-pooling operation of a convolutional neural network. Consider the problem of classifying a sequence. Because some sequences are longer than others, the number of features is irregular. Given a specific sequence, the challenge is to determine the appropriate permutation of features with weights, allowing us to run the features through the statistical classifier to generate a prediction. To find the permutation of features that will exhibit the maximal response, like how max-pooling identifies the image patch that will exhibit the maximal response, we use a sequence alignment algorithm. Given the immense number of possible permutations, the problem appears computationally complex but can be solved in polynomial time using a sequence alignment algorithm, like the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needlemanâ€“Wunsch_algorithm). Equivalents to a sequence alignment algorithm exist for (i) sets, (ii) trees, and (iii) graphs, making it possible to use DKM on non-conforming features represented using these structures (*The general problem of graph alignment is considered NP-hard*).

To illustrate the types of non-conforming features that we can handle with DKM, we consider two datasets of T-cell receptors, anticipating these datasets to contain signatures for diagnosing disease.

###### Antigen Classification Problem
10x Genomics has published a dataset of sequenced T-cell receptors labelled by interaction with disease particles, which are called antigens [(link)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/application-notes/a-new-way-of-exploring-immunity-linking-highly-multiplexed-antigen-recognition-to-immune-repertoire-and-phenotype/). We refer to this as the antigen classification problem. To solve the antigen classification problem, we use DKM to classify each sequence in this dataset. See the folder `antigen-classification-problem` details.

###### Repertoire Classification Problem
Adaptive Biotechnologies has published a separate dataset of patients' sequenced T-cell receptors, which are called immune repertoires, labelled by those patients' CMV status [(link)](https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/pub/emerson-2017-natgen).
We refer to this as the repertoire classification problem. To solve the repertoire classification problem, we use DKM to classify each set of sequences in this dataset. See the folder `repertoire-classification-problem` for details.

###### Study Design
Training data is used to fit a model, validation data is used for model selection, and test data is used for reporting results. We strictly adhered to this protocol, ensuring that we avoid a model selection bias when reporting results.

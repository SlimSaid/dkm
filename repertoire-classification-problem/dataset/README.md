## Repertoire Classification Dataset

Adaptive Biotechnologies has published a separate dataset of immune repertoires labelled by CMV exposure that we refer to as the
repertoire classification dataset [(link)](https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/pub/emerson-2017-natgen). For each patient, their
age and β-chain CDR3 sequences and copy numbers in peripheral blood provide features of their repertoire. Unlike the antigen
classification dataset, receptors are not labelled by pMHC, but rather the T-cell repertoire is labelled by the patient’s CMV
serostatus. 

Samples have been built from this dataset and split into a training, validation, and test set. The samples are stored in a HDF5 file under database.h5. The file, which is over 5GB, is too large to store here. Click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gzp8qy613qeiylx/database.h5?dl=0) to download the database file, which should be placed in this folder.

## Repertoire Classification Dataset

Adaptive Biotechnologies has published a separate dataset of immune repertoires labelled by CMV exposure that we refer to as the
repertoire classification dataset [(link)](https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/pub/emerson-2017-natgen). For each patient, their
age and β-chain CDR3 sequences and copy numbers in peripheral blood provide features of their repertoire. Unlike the antigen
classification dataset, receptors are not labelled by pMHC, but rather the T-cell repertoire is labelled by the patient’s CMV
serostatus.
